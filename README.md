# Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys

## Summary
This project deals with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

The aim of this project is to clean, analyze the data and combine the results for both surveys to answer the following questions:
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?


After exploring, cleaning and analyzing the data, it was concluded that for question 1, there is a definite split between the long serving members of staff and the less experienced staff. The 'New' and 'Experienced' groups both have a dissatisfaction rate between 30% and 40%. Meanwhile, the 'Established' and 'Veteran' groups both have a much higher dissatisfaction rate between 60% and 70%. We can therefore conclude that the longer employees stay at the TAFE and DETE institues the more likely they are to resign due to resignation.

For question 2, there is only one outlier in the different ages. Resignations of people who were 20 or below had a roughly 20% dissatisfaction rate whilst all other age groups were between 40% and 50%. This could be realted to question number 1 because the 20 and below employees have much less time to grow dissatisfied. However, we only have a sample size of 10 for employees who were less than 20 so it is dangerous to read too much into this outlier. On the whole, age has little affect on the likelihood of resigning due to dissatisfaction.
